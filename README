Welcome to the Anansi CalcPad's Git MASTER Branch.

As the original version of Anansi CalcPad, developed by us at Seafire Software for Raindolf at Oasis Websoft, you will see the original version of Anansi CalcPad in it's full.

Anansi CalcPad is being developed in joint with Oasis WebSoft for one sole reason: To bring the news of Web 2.0 to the masses in Africa. The Web as we Americans know it, in it's full beauty, is not as known in Africa, and Oasis WebSoft's goal is to fix that. Thus, they contracted us to develop this app.

Anansi CalcPad is a three-in-one application. It has three separate views, one is the Calculator view, the second is our "StoryPad" view, and the third is the news aggregator (pre-set with popular Web-2.0 news websites, but you can add/remove any.)
