**NOTE: As of version 1.4, you must install Visual Studio 2008 Redistributal for x86, if it isn't already installed. If you get an error upon starting the executable, try installing the redistributable (vcredist_x86.exe) from "Windows" folder first.

Welcome to the Anansi CalcPad's Git MASTER Branch.

As the original version of Anansi CalcPad, developed by us at Seafire Software for Raindolf at Oasis Websoft, you will see the original version of Anansi CalcPad in it's full.

Anansi CalcPad is being developed in joint with Oasis WebSoft for one sole reason: To bring the news of Web 2.0 to the masses in Africa. The Web as we Americans know it, in it's full beauty, is not as known in Africa, and Oasis WebSoft's goal is to fix that. Thus, they contracted us to develop this app.

Basically, Anansi Calcpad is a tri-view program. The first view, known as CalcPad, is just a simple Calculator. The second, known as StoryPad, is a journaling side. The third, known as NewsPad, is a news aggregator.
